# README

An EventBrite like application to arrange meetups. A project from The Odin Project.
See www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.


* Outline - Build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events 
and attend events. A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be 
attended by many users. This will require you to model a many-to-many relationship and also 
to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names.
